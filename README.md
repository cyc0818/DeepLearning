# DeepLearning

Autoencoder are commonly used for tasks like image resolution enhancement. Each grid cell contains three channels (RGB). We orga‚Äê nized the data into a grid, where each cell has two channels: time and charge, and trained the model to extract the true time.

The time reconstruction resolution was improved by 41%.
